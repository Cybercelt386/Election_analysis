With this information we can determine the winner of the election, the margin by which the winning candidate took the election, as well as what county had the biggest turnout. With this information future candidates can shape their campaigns to increase their chances of success by focusing on counties with high voter participation and looking at the successful candidates to determine how to shape their own messages in the future. With a couple of code edits this program can be used to gather valuable statistical data about any election and determine voter trends in the long and short terms.
